      "description": "Chocolate was first seen in bar form around 1910. Dark chocolate is made from the roasted beans of the cacao tree and has many health benefits. From improving bad cholesterol to lowering blood pressure, helping to reduce stress and improving vision, it’s definitely worth eating a square or two a day. A study by Harvard also found that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day prevented memory decline. Drink up!",

      "description": "Avocados are classified as a berry with a large seed. Avocados must be picked when matured in order to ripen, which can take between 1-2 weeks. In Spain and Mexico, avocados are called “alligator pears” due to their shape and bumpy, green skin, while in India and China, they are referred to as “butter pears”. This healthy food is good for you too! They're a great source of vitamin C, E, K, and B-6.",

      "description": "Former President George W Bush may have once famously proclaimed: “I’m president of the United States and I’m not going to eat any more broccoli,” but don’t listen to him! Besides the usual nutrition one gets from eating their greens, broccoli has a great deal of protein. Calorie for calorie, there is more protein in broccoli than steak. And it doesn’t come with all those saturated and trans fats or cholesterol, so you can get all the protein you need with a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease with this healthy food.",
